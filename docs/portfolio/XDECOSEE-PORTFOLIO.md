# Project Portfolio - Ho Si Shi Annette
## 1. Project Overview
This portfolio describes the contributions that I made to my school project, [WalletCLi](https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-W17-2/main).  As a team with 3 other CS2113T Software Engineering students, our group implemented a Command Line Interface application, called **WalletCLi**. 

**WalletCLi** primarily caters to NUS students and staff who prefer to use a desktop application for managing their monthly expenditure. Users can store their records of their expenses and loans with WalletCLi. In addition, **WalletCLi** provide features for users to keep track of their monthly budget and analyse their expenditure through statistics. On top of these features, users can export and import data to and from **WalletCLi**. The application is written in Java.

### 2.2 Features Implemented
* Contact Management
  * _What it Does_: For each loan entry in the application, users will be required to tag them with the contacts details of the person whom they borrow or lend money to. 
  * _How it Works_: Users can manage their contact list by adding, editing or deleting contacts. Each contact will require the name of the contact. Additionally, users can optionally provide the contact's phone number or other details.
* Export/Import Data
  * _What it Does_: For exporting data, users can transfer records of their loans or monthly expenses from **WalletCLi** to CSV files.For importing data, users can transfer records of their loans or monthly expenses from CSV files to **WalletCLi**. 
  * _Justification_: For users who are not comfortable with a Command Line Interface, they can still utilise our statistics feature to have a quick analysis their monthly expenditure by importing their data into **WalletCLi**. 
  In future releases of **WalletCLi**, we want to include a feature to allow users create multiple 'wallets' within the application so that they manage different groups of expenses. For example, users may create multiple wallets to track their personal expenses  As a result, NUS students may create different wallet
