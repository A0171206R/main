## About this Portfolio
## 1. Overview
This portfolio describes the contributions that I made to my school project, [WalletCLi](https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-W17-2/main).  As a team with 3 other CS2113T Software Engineering students, our group implemented a Command Line Interface application, called WalletCLi. 

WalletCLi is for NUS students and staff who prefer to use a desktop application for managing their monthly expenditure. Users can store their records of their expenses and loans with WalletCLi. In addition, WalletCli provide features for users to keep track of their monthly budget and analyse their expenditure through statistics. On top of these features, users can export and import data to and from WalletCLi. The application is written in Java.
